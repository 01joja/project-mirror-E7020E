#### Evaluation
##### Major
- The sensor does not always register, our primary guess fo the reason is that the sensor is a bit high.
- The scroll button is a bit slow.
- Hardware debounce

##### Minor
- More RBG Leds
- Change the resistor for the leds
- Small changes with the 3d print.
- Bigger mouse
- Scroll Wheel hole should be bigger.
