The shell we found on the internet that meat our demands where of a [Logitech G305](https://www.logitechg.com/sv-se/products/gaming-mice/g305-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse.910-005283.html).

[Original design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4084764) and [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Gaming-Mouse-G305/).


## Design of hardware:

The hardware design where somewhat inspired form the [G305 PCB](https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/isist1/trimming_guide_for_the_g305_pcb_as_used_in_my/). At least where the buttons goes, the location of the scroll wheel and where the sensor is mounted. Also some of the screw holes came directly from this design. But most of the general layout where things Tommy figured out.
