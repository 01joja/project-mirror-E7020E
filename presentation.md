## What works?  

- Nearly everything works on the PCB:s.
  - All buttons can be registered.
  - Encoder for the scroll wheel.
  - Sensor.
  - RGB.
- 3D-print:
  - The shell and button alignment works most of the time.
- USB communication.
  - send left, right and scroll click.
  - send up and down scroll.
  - send movement of mouse.

## Issues

- The PCB needs a few tweaks.
  - The footprint for the ESD-protection needs to change. Right now it dose not fit.
  - The footprints for the 3.3V and 1.9 converter should be changed to fit hand soldering. Right now they are troublesome to hand solder.
  - The footprint for the clock could be a little bit smaller. Right now it takes up too much space.
