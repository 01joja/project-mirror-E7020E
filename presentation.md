# Software

- The computer polls the mouse.
- The mouse button 1, 2 and 3, (left, right, middle) uses HID,
- The x and y posistions gets coverted to 8 bit, and sent using HID.
- Sidebuttons are mouse button 4,5 and works as forward and backwards.

# Testing and validation

* Design test
  * _Dose it feels good?_
* Operation system test
  * Windows 
  * Mac
  * Linux
* Mouse test
  * Tested with light activity for 2 hours
  * Tested gaming
    * CS
  * Tested on mouse testsites

## What works?  

- Nearly everything works on the PCB:s.
  - All buttons can be registered.
  - Encoder for the scroll wheel.
  - Sensor.
  - RGB.
- 3D-print:
  - The shell and button alignment works most of the time.
- USB communication.
  - send left, right and scroll click.
  - send up and down scroll.
  - send movement of mouse.



## Issues

- The PCB needs a few tweaks.
  - The footprint for the ESD-protection needs to change. Right now it dose not fit.
  - The footprints for the 3.3V and 1.9 converter should be changed to fit hand soldering. Right now they are troublesome to hand solder.
  - The footprint for the crystal could be a little bit smaller. Right now it takes up too much space.



## Evaluation
##### Major
- The sensor does not always register, our primary guess for the reason is that the sensor is a bit high.
- The scroll button is a bit slow.
- Hardware debounce
- Cabel

##### Minor
- More RGB Leds
- Change the resistor for the leds
- Small changes with the 3d print.
- Bigger mouse
- Scroll Wheel.
